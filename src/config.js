  intro: `Hi, I'm Vishnu.

I’ve always been drawn to the thinking part exploring ideas, dissecting systems, mixing philosophy with technology to understand not just what I know, but how I know it.

That curiosity taught me something important:

In complex systems, bugs aren’t created by code.

They’re created by mental models.

Somewhere along the way, I realized I’m a lifelong learner.

And the best way to learn is to teach.

By day, I’m a Senior Software Engineer at Qualcomm, working deep inside the Linux kernel, device drivers, and open-source systems - the kind of places where correctness, concurrency, and clarity truly matter.

By night (and in the quiet gaps between), I distill what I learn into simple thinking tools:

- Mental models for debugging complex systems
- Linux kernel stories and subtle lifetime mysteries
- Practical, real-world ways to use AI beyond tech demos
- Productivity systems designed for messy, modern workflows
- Reflections where technology, life, and philosophy intersect

And sometimes… the small, beautiful corners of the internet worth sharing.

I write weekly posts and in-depth articles that turn tricky engineering concepts into clear, reusable insights.

Because with the right tools and the right mindset - we can transform the way we build, think, and work.

If that sounds like a journey worth taking, stick around.
